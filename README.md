## Getting Started

You will need node >= 16.X.X to run this project properly

If you have `nvm` installed, running `nvm use` will automatically switch to the correct node version.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
